Here's what I'll do to resolve this:
1. I'm issuing an immediate refund of $29.99 for the duplicate charge. You should see it back on your card within 3-5 business days.
2. I've flagged your account to prevent this from happening again.
3. I'll send you a confirmation email with the refund reference number.

Is there anything else I can help you with regarding your account?`,
